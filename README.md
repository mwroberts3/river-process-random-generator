https://river-process.netlify.app


## Purpose
- Helps remove the hassle of planning out your week
- Smartly randomizes it, so it keeps things a little more interesting, everyday has a unique feel

## Usage
- Todo lists can be uploaded in the form of a .csv file
  - A sample editable file, [River Process Template](https://github.com/mwroberts3/river-process-random-generator/blob/master/River%20Process%20Template.csv) is included in this repo
  - Rows contain seven columns: Task, Main Category, Sub Category, Times Per Week, Custom Color, Minutes, Active
        - All custom .csv files need to have these column headers
  - To ensure proper functionality: any information in a given column CANNOT contain commas
<br>
- Uploaded .csv files can have weekly tasks re-randomized by click on the 'Randomize Tasks' button underneath the 'Tasks Per Day' header

## Future Versions
### Known Bugs:
- Clicking on the text in the category chart does nothing, user has to click on actual color bar for the sub-chart to generate
- Clicking on a new main category while a different one is already displayed should close the current sub-category display and open the new one
- Sorting by minutes not working
